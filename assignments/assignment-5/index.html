                    <p><span class="input-value" data-input="input-1"></span> Rescue in <span class="input-value" data-input="input-2"></span> said a <span class="input-value" data-input="input-3"></span> that made headlines for blocking a freeway in January is undergoing a behavior analysis after being rescued from a storm drain.

The rescue team said the <span class="input-value" data-input="input-3"></span>, nicknamed Freeway after being rescued from Route <span class="input-value" data-input="input-4"></span> in downtown <span class="input-value" data-input="input-2"></span> on Jan. 7, returned to <span class="input-value" data-input="input-1"></span>'s custody after being spotted in a storm drain under the <span class="input-value" data-input="input-5"></span> Bridge on April 7.

Rescuers said the storm drain would have led Freeway back to the same spot where he was rescued in January.

Freeway was previously rescued when he was found walking on to <span class="input-value" data-input="input-6"></span> Drive in <span class="input-value" data-input="input-2"></span> in November 2021.

<span class="input-value" data-input="input-1"></span> said Freeway is now undergoing a behavioral analysis with veterinarians and marine experts to determine why the <span class="input-value" data-input="input-3"></span>, estimated to be 10-13 years old, keeps wandering inland.

"We want him to be in a safe situation," <span class="input-value" data-input="input-1"></span> Rescue team supervisor <span class="input-value" data-input="input-7"></span> told the <span class="input-value" data-input="input-2"></span> Union-Tribune. "We want to do what is best for the <span class="input-value" data-input="input-3"></span>. Right now, because he has been rescued three times in unsafe situations, we are trying to figure out what his plan is."
